# HttpMessageSigning

A C# implementation of the "Authorization" scheme of the IETF Internet-Draft [Signing HTTP Messages](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-12).

It is an implementation that uses symmetric keys. The server needs a mapping between the key, used to sign the contents, and the authorized entity.
Assymetric keys, which would allow server authentication without prior knowledge of the client, is currently out-of-scope.

Targets .NET Standard 2.0.
